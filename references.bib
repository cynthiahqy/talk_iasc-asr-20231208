Despite the availability of numerous visualization techniques, the large size of hierarchical classifications and complex relations between taxonomic entities generated during a multi-taxonomy alignment process requires new visualizations. This paper introduces ProvenanceMatrix, a novel tool allowing end users (taxonomists, ecologists, phylogeneticists) to explore and comprehend the outcomes of taxonomic alignments. We illustrate the use of ProvenanceMatrix through examples using taxonomic classifications of various sizes, from a few to hundreds of taxonomic entities and hundreds of thousands of relationships.},

  abstract = {Identifying coordinated relationships is an important task in data analytics. For example, an intelligence analyst might want to discover three suspicious people who all visited the same four cities. Existing techniques that display individual relationships, such as between lists of entities, require repetitious manual selection and significant mental aggregation in cluttered visualizations to find coordinated relationships. In this paper, we present BiSet, a visual analytics technique to support interactive exploration of coordinated relationships. In BiSet, we model coordinated relationships as biclusters and algorithmically mine them from a dataset. Then, we visualize the biclusters in context as bundled edges between sets of related entities. Thus, bundles enable analysts to infer task-oriented semantic insights about potentially coordinated activities. We make bundles as first class objects and add a new layer, “in-between”, to contain these bundle objects. Based on this, bundles serve to organize entities represented in lists and visually reveal their membership. Users can interact with edge bundles to organize related entities, and vice versa, for sensemaking purposes. With a usage scenario, we demonstrate how BiSet supports the exploration of coordinated relationships in text analytics.},

In particular websites categorized as social media provide rich and heterogeneous data about various entities such as people, corporations, brands as well as their properties and relationships. An analyst who seeks to leverage this diverse data is faced with the challenge of integrating and making sense of a set of heterogeneous data sources. In this paper, we provide an introduction and a problem statement for heterogeneous web data analytics. To further highlight and discuss practical challenges, we introduce a case study of Finnish growth companies in social media. Instead of a purely data-driven approach, the presented approach is rooted in the idea that an analyst can actively participate in the data collection and integration process, while the process can still retain repeatability and transparency. The key contribution of this paper is the statement of the challenges related to heterogeneous web data analytics.},

Researchers increasingly combine data from different survey projects to analyze them as a single dataset, and while teams engaged in data harmonization continue to expand the information they provide to end users, there are still no commonly agreed standards for the documentation of data processing. Existing harmonization project typically opt for recode scripts that are generally hard to read, modify, and reuse, although some projects make efforts to facilitate verification and reproduction. This paper describes an alternative procedure and a set of simple tools for the exploration, recoding, and documentation of harmonization of survey data, relying on crosswalks. The presented tools are flexible and software-agnostic. The illustrative example uses the programming language R and spreadsheets\textemdash both common software choices among social scientists. Harmonization of variables on trust in institutions from four major cross-national survey projects serves as an illustration of the proposed workflow and of opportunities harmonization creates.},

Provenance can be captured on varying levels of detail, and in turn activities can be characterized from different granularities. However, current approaches do not support inferring activities that can only be characterized across multiple levels of provenance. We propose a task abstraction framework that consists of a three stage approach, composed of 1) initializing a provenance task hierarchy, 2) parsing the provenance hierarchy by using an abstraction mapping mechanism, and 3) leveraging the task hierarchy in an analytical tool. Furthermore, we identify implications to accommodate iterative refinement, context, variability, and uncertainty during all stages of the framework. We describe a use case which exemplifies our abstraction framework, demonstrating how context can influence the provenance hierarchy to support analysis. The article concludes with an agenda, raising and discussing challenges that need to be considered for successfully implementing such a framework.},

This model provides prescriptive guidance for determining appropriate evaluation approaches by identifying threats to validity unique to each level. We also provide three recommendations motivated by this model: authors should distinguish between these levels when claiming contributions at more than one of them, authors should explicitly state upstream assumptions at levels above the focus of a paper, and visualization venues should accept more papers on domain characterization.},

Capturing workflow provenance along the wrangling process and combining it with descriptive information as data provenance can enable users to comprehend how these changes affected the dataset, and if they benefited data quality. We present DQProv Explorer , a system that captures and visualizes provenance from data wrangling operations. It features three visualization components, allowing the user to explore (1) the provenance graph of operations and the data stream, (2) the development of quality over time for a sequence of wrangling operations applied to the dataset, and (3) the distribution of issues across the entirety of the dataset to determine error patterns.},

Dual trees can be drawn in various styles, including an indented outline style, and allow users to browse general multitrees in addition to genealogical graphs, by transitioning between different dual tree views. A software prototype for such browsing is described, that supports smoothly animated transitions, automatic camera framing, rotation of subtrees, and a novel interaction technique for expanding or collapsing subtrees to any depth with a single mouse drag},

To enable broad discovery and access to research dataset, some data repositories have begun leveraging the web architecture by embedding structured metadata markup in dataset web landing pages using vocabularies from Schema.org and extensions. This paper aims to examine metadata interoperability for supporting global data discovery. Specifically, the paper reports a survey on which metadata schema has been adopted by participating data repositories, and presents an analysis of crosswalks from fourteen research data schemas to Schema.org. The analysis indicates most descriptive metadata are interoperable among the schemas, the most inconsistent mapping is the rights metadata, and a large gap exists in the structural metadata and controlled vocabularies to specify various property values. The analysis and collated crosswalks can serve as a reference for data repositories when they develop crosswalks from their own schemas to Schema.org, and provide the research data community a benchmark of structured metadata implementation.},

  abstract = {Analyzing large data sets are challenging. Most data analytics research has proposed parallel algorithms that outside a DBMS because SQL is considered inadequate for complexity computations. R and Python are popular analysis systems that provide a vast collection of mathematical models and functions. However, they are limited by main memory and single computer. Recently, parallel DBMSs have significantly improved query processing performance. Moreover, SQL queries are elegant and efficient. This paper introduces a novel system architecture integrating a popular analysis system and parallel DBMSs, which has the matrix multiplication involving a large matrix evaluated inside a parallel DBMS and complex mathematical computations are done in R or Python. Many graph problems can be solved by matrix multiplication. In this paper, we show optimized queries which perform matrix multiplication in DBMSs to solve two fundamental graph problems, single-source reachability and transitive closure.},
